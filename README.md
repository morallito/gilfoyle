# Gilfoyle
A biased terraform CLI. 
"What do I do? I make sure that one bad configuration in a key component does not bankrupt your entire company."

What is Gilfoyle: 

Gilfoyle is a biased terraform CLI. The intention of this project is to create a terraform CLI that generates templates  to make easy the getting started and scaffold terraform examples and templates. 

Since I'm inspired by the book Terraform up and running, the first provider that i'm going to use is AWS.

Azure and Oracle are also in the road map to be added in the project.
